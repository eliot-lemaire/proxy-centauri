# Centauri — Progress Log

## 2026-04-06
- Investigated and fixed bug where "all star systems are dead" log appeared to refer to the whole proxy rather than a specific gate — added `name` field to `PulseScan` so every log line now includes the gate name (e.g. `tcp-app`)
- Fixed `docker-compose.yml`: added `healthcheck` blocks to `echo-http` and `echo-tcp`, and changed `centauri` `depends_on` to `condition: service_healthy` to prevent startup race
- Verified fix: stopping TCP backend (`echo-tcp`) no longer makes HTTP gate (`web-app`) appear down; logs clearly attribute failures to the correct gate
- Stress tested with `hey` (10,000 req @ 50 concurrency): 100% 200s under normal load, no panics under backend restart mid-run
