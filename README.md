## About

Proxy Centauri is a Go reverse proxy that routes HTTP and TCP traffic through a YAML-defined configuration called `centauri.yml`. It is protocol-aware, health-checking, and hot-reloadable — no restarts needed when you update your routes.

Routes are called **Jump Gates**, backends are **Star Systems**, the built-in health checker is **Pulse Scan**, and the active load balancer is the **Orbital Router**.

Ships as a ~10 MB Docker image built from a multi-stage `golang:1.22-alpine` → `alpine:3.19` pipeline. Drop in a `centauri.yml`, run `docker compose up`, and traffic is flowing.

---

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **L7 HTTP Reverse Proxy** | Forwards HTTP requests via Go's `httputil.ReverseProxy`; preserves real client IP with `X-Forwarded-For`; returns `502` on backend error, `503` when all Star Systems are unreachable |
| **L4 TCP Tunneling** | Bidirectional byte pipe — protocol-agnostic; works for databases, game servers, or any raw TCP service |
| **Orbital Router — Round-Robin LB** | Lock-free atomic counter; concurrent-safe; distributes requests evenly across all live Star Systems |
| **Pulse Scan Health Checker** | HTTP: `GET` with 2s timeout (any `< 500` response = alive); TCP: raw dial with 2s timeout; checks every 5s; auto-removes dead backends and restores them on recovery |
| **Config Hot-Reload** | `fsnotify` watches `centauri.yml`; reloads without dropping connections or restarting the process |
| **Multi-Stage Docker Build** | `golang:1.22-alpine` builder → `alpine:3.19` runtime; final image ~10 MB |
| **Graceful Shutdown** | Listens for `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`; drains cleanly before exit |

## Quick Start

### With Docker Compose (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/eliot-lemaire/proxy-centauri.git
cd proxy-centauri

# 2. Optionally edit the config (the defaults work out of the box)
cp centauri.example.yml centauri.yml

# 3. Launch
docker compose up --build
```

Verify it's running:

```bash
# Test the HTTP Jump Gate
curl http://localhost:8000/

# Test the TCP Jump Gate
echo "hello" | nc localhost 9000
```

To run in the background: `docker compose up -d --build`
To stop: `docker compose down`

### From Source

> Requires Go 1.22+. `centauri.yml` must exist in the working directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eliot-lemaire/proxy-centauri.git
cd proxy-centauri
go run ./cmd/centauri

# Or build first
go build -o centauri ./cmd/centauri && ./centauri
```

### What You'll See on Boot

```text
  [ Mission Control ] Initializing...
  [ Mission Control ] 2 jump gate(s) configured
  [ Jump Gate       ] "web-app"  →  :8000  (http)
  [ Star System     ]     echo-http:3000
  [ Pulse Scan      ] health checks every 5s
  [ Orbital Router  ] listening on :8000 — ready to route
  [ Jump Gate       ] "tcp-app"  →  :9000  (tcp)
  [ Star System     ]     echo-tcp:3003
  [ Pulse Scan      ] health checks every 5s
  [ Orbital Router  ] listening on :9000 — ready to tunnel
  [ Mission Control ] Ready. Watching for config changes...
```

## Configuration

`centauri.yml` is the single source of truth. It is hot-reloaded on save — no restart required.

```yaml
mission_control:
  port: 8080          # Reserved: web dashboard port (not yet active)
  secret: "change-me" # Reserved: dashboard auth secret

jump_gates:

  # HTTP Reverse Proxy
  # Forwards web traffic to one or more Star Systems via httputil.ReverseProxy.
  # Sets X-Forwarded-For on every request.
  # Returns 502 Bad Gateway on backend error; 503 when all Star Systems are unreachable.
  - name: "web-app"         # Unique identifier, shown in logs
    listen: ":8000"          # Bind address — ":8000" = all interfaces on port 8000
    protocol: http           # "http" or "tcp"
    star_systems:
      - address: "myapp:3000"  # host:port — Docker service name, IP, or hostname
        weight: 1              # Reserved for weighted LB (not yet active)
      - address: "myapp:3001"  # Add more Star Systems for load balancing
        weight: 1

  # TCP Tunnel
  # Forwards raw bytes bidirectionally — protocol-agnostic.
  # Works for: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, game servers, MQTT, SSH, anything TCP.
  - name: "db-proxy"
    listen: ":5432"
    protocol: tcp
    star_systems:
      - address: "postgres:5432"
```

> [!WARNING]
> Change `mission_control.secret` before deploying to any networked environment. The default value `"change-me"` is not secure.

## How It Works

<details>
<summary>Pulse Scan — Health Checking</summary>

Pulse Scan runs a background health check loop every 5 seconds per Jump Gate.

- **HTTP backends:** Sends a `GET /` with a 2-second timeout. Any HTTP response below status `500` is considered alive.
- **TCP backends:** Attempts a raw `net.DialTimeout` with a 2-second timeout. A successful connection is considered alive.

When a backend fails a check it is immediately removed from the Orbital Router's active pool. When it recovers, it is automatically restored. If all Star Systems go offline, Pulse Scan logs a warning and new HTTP connections receive `503 Service Unavailable` until at least one backend recovers.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Orbital Router — Load Balancing</summary>

The Orbital Router uses a round-robin algorithm to distribute requests across all live Star Systems.

- **Lock-free hot path:** A `sync/atomic` `uint64` counter is incremented per request — no mutex on the request path.
- **Safe backend updates:** A `sync.RWMutex` wraps the backend slice, allowing Pulse Scan to add/remove backends while requests are in-flight.
- **Empty pool handling:** `Next()` returns an empty string safely when no backends are available, triggering a `503` at the proxy layer.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Config Hot-Reload</summary>

`fsnotify` watches `centauri.yml` for `Write` and `Create` events. On change:

1. The YAML is re-parsed and validated.
2. The new config is logged: `[ Config ] Reloaded — N jump gate(s)`.
3. An `onChange` callback is invoked with the new config struct.

> [!NOTE]
> In v0.1.0, hot-reload updates the config in memory and notifies the application, but does not restart active listeners. Changes to `listen` addresses or new Jump Gates take effect on the next process restart. Dynamic listener restart is planned for a future release.

</details>
